# Introduction to Imaging and Image-Based Anatomy

Welcome to the **Introduction to Imaging and Image-Based Anatomy** repository! This repository contains a collection of projects and resources developed during my studies in the course "Introduction to Imaging and Image-Based Anatomy." The course explores the fundamentals of medical imaging modalities and their applications in anatomy and diagnostics. Here, you'll find a variety of projects, tools, and resources that demonstrate the integration of imaging technologies with anatomy and artificial intelligence.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

This repository is organized into several projects and tools, each focusing on different aspects of medical imaging and anatomy. Below is an overview of the main components:

### 1. **Dicom Viewer**
   - A tool for viewing and analyzing DICOM files, which are the standard format for medical imaging data.
   - Features include image manipulation, zoom, pan, and window-level adjustments.

### 2. **Organ Classifier using AI**
   - An AI-based tool that classifies organs in medical images using machine learning techniques.
   - This project demonstrates the application of AI in automating the identification of anatomical structures.

### 3. **OrthoView - 3D Medical Image Viewer**
   - A 3D medical image viewer that allows for the visualization of complex anatomical structures.
   - Supports various imaging modalities, including CT and MRI, and provides tools for 3D reconstruction and analysis.

### 4. **Quantum Precession Scanner**
   - A **science fiction concept** exploring the integration of quantum sensors with fMRI technology to break the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.
   - This project aims to create a revolutionary imaging device capable of real-time, high-resolution neural activity mapping, particularly for OCD-related neural circuits.

### 5. **Skeleton Puzzle Game**
   - An educational game designed to help users learn about human anatomy by assembling a virtual skeleton.
   - This interactive tool is a fun way to engage with anatomical structures and their relationships.

### 6. **YOLO Model**
  As part of our biomedical engineering studies, we utilized the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to learn about real-time object detection and tracking.

This project involved training the YOLO model to analyze football matches, detecting and tracking players, the ball, and other key elements during a match. This provided valuable insights into player movements and game dynamics, while also helping us understand the practical applications of AI in real-time data analysis.
