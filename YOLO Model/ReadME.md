You should write this in a file called **`README.md`** in your GitHub repository. The `README.md` file is the first thing people see when they visit your repository, and it‚Äôs where you explain what your project does, how to set it up, and how to use it.

Here‚Äôs how you can do it step by step:

---

### Step 1: Go to Your GitHub Repository
1. Open your web browser and go to your GitHub repository.
2. If you haven‚Äôt created a repository yet, click the **"New"** button on the GitHub homepage to create one.

---

### Step 2: Create the `README.md` File
1. Inside your repository, click the **"Add file"** button (it‚Äôs near the top right of the page).
2. Select **"Create new file"** from the dropdown menu.

---

### Step 3: Name the File
1. In the file name field, type **`README.md`**.
   - The `.md` extension stands for **Markdown**, which is the language GitHub uses for formatting text.

---

### Step 4: Paste the Content
1. Copy the **entire block of text** I provided earlier.
2. Paste it into the text editor on GitHub (where it says "Edit new file").

---

### Step 5: Save the File
1. Scroll down to the bottom of the page.
2. In the **"Commit new file"** section, write a short description like **"Added README.md file"**.
3. Click the green **"Commit new file"** button.

---

### Step 6: Verify the `README.md` File
1. After saving, you‚Äôll see the `README.md` file in your repository.
2. GitHub will automatically render the Markdown content, so it will look nice and formatted.

---

### What Happens Next?
- When someone visits your repository, they‚Äôll see the `README.md` file displayed right below the list of files.
- This is where they‚Äôll read about your project, how to set it up, and how to use it.

# üé• YOLO Video Detection with Player-Specific Heatmap

This project is a Python application that uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to detect players in a video, track their movements, and generate player-specific heatmaps. Built with `tkinter` for the GUI, `OpenCV` for video processing, and `ultralytics` for YOLO model integration, this tool is perfect for analyzing sports videos (e.g., football/soccer) and visualizing player movements on a heatmap overlaid on a football pitch.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Player Detection**: Detect players in a video using a pre-trained YOLO model.
- **Player Tracking**: Track players across frames and assign unique IDs to each player.
- **Heatmap Generation**: Generate heatmaps for individual players based on their movement throughout the video.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Easily upload videos, process them, and view heatmaps with a simple interface.
- **Multi-Threading**: Process videos and play them back in separate threads for a smooth user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python packages:

- `tkinter` (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
- `opencv-python`
- `ultralytics`
- `numpy`

Install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python ultralytics numpy
```

## üöÄ Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Download YOLO Model**:

   - Download the YOLO model weights file (e.g., `best.pt`) and place it in the project directory.
   - Update the `model` path in the script to point to your model file.

3. **Football Pitch Background**:

   - Download a football pitch image (e.g., `pitch_background.png`) and place it in the project directory.
   - Update the `pitch_background` path in the script to point to your image file.

4. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

## üéÆ Usage

1. **Upload a Video**:
   - Click the "Upload Video" button to select a video file (e.g., `.mp4`, `.avi`).
   - Choose a folder to save the processed video.

2. **View Processed Video**:
   - The processed video will be displayed in a new window once the processing is complete.
   - Press `q` to exit the video playback.

3. **Generate Heatmap**:
   - After processing the video, select a player ID from the list.
   - Click the "Select Player for Heatmap" button to generate and view the heatmap for the selected player.

## üß© How It Works

1. **Video Upload**:
   - The user uploads a video file, which is processed frame-by-frame using the YOLO model to detect players.

2. **Player Tracking**:
   - Each detected player is assigned a unique ID.
   - Players are tracked across frames using a distance-based matching algorithm.

3. **Heatmap Generation**:
   - The movement of each player is recorded and stored as a list of coordinates.
   - A heatmap is generated for the selected player by plotting their movement on a football pitch background.

4. **Video Playback**:
   - The processed video (with bounding boxes and player IDs) is saved and can be played back in a new window.

## üîß Customization

1. **YOLO Model**:
   - Train your own YOLO model or use a pre-trained model for specific use cases (e.g., different sports or objects).
   - Update the `model` path in the script to use your custom model.

2. **Heatmap Intensity**:
   - Adjust the intensity of the heatmap by modifying the value in the `heatmap[y, x] += 10` line in the `show_player_heatmap` function.

3. **Football Pitch Background**:
   - Replace the `pitch_background.png` file with a different image to customize the heatmap background.

4. **Max Distance for Player Tracking**:
   - Adjust the `max_distance` variable in the `get_player_id` function to control how far a player can move between frames before being assigned a new ID.

## üóÇÔ∏è Code Structure

- **`detect_and_save_video`**: Processes the video, detects players, and saves the processed video.
- **`get_player_id`**: Tracks players across frames and assigns unique IDs.
- **`show_player_heatmap`**: Generates and displays a heatmap for a selected player.
- **`play_video`**: Plays the processed video in a new window.
- **`upload_video`**: Handles video upload and initiates processing.
- **`populate_player_list`**: Populates the list of player IDs in the GUI.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- **Multi-Player Heatmaps**: Generate heatmaps for multiple players simultaneously.
- **Advanced Tracking**: Implement more robust player tracking algorithms (e.g., Kalman filters).
- **Export Heatmaps**: Add functionality to save heatmaps as image files.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the code for faster processing of high-resolution videos.
- **Custom Sports**: Extend the application to support other sports (e.g., basketball, hockey).
