# Quantum Precession Scanner: Breaking the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Advanced Neural Imaging

Welcome to the **Quantum Precession Scanner** repository! This project explores a **science fiction concept** where we break one of the fundamental laws of physics‚Äî**Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**‚Äîto create a revolutionary imaging device capable of real-time, high-resolution neural activity mapping. This device, combining **quantum sensors** with **fMRI technology**, aims to provide unprecedented insights into neural circuits, particularly those related to **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)**.

## üìñ Overview

The **Quantum Precession Scanner** is a next-generation imaging system that leverages **quantum entanglement** and **coherence** to surpass the limitations of classical physics. Traditional fMRI systems rely on **Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signals**, which introduce delays and lack the precision needed to capture fast neural activity. By integrating **quantum sensors**, this device directly detects **electrical signals from neurons**, enabling real-time, high-resolution imaging of brain activity.

### Key Features:
- **Breaks Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**: Achieves simultaneous precision in position and momentum measurements, enabling superior spatial and temporal resolution.
- **Real-Time Neural Activity Mapping**: Directly detects electrical signals from neurons, bypassing the delays associated with traditional fMRI.
- **Low-Power Quantum Algorithms**: Implements energy-efficient algorithms and dynamic energy allocation to reduce power consumption in practical applications.
- **OCD Neural Circuit Mapping**: Provides detailed insights into OCD-related neural circuits, improving diagnostic accuracy and understanding of the disorder.
